# Ethical-AI Dataset

This repository contains a collection of images and video generated by MLLMs(Multimodal Large Language Models) such as Copilot, and T2I/V models such as StableDiffusion3-2B, or through the use of web Platforms, such as Decohere.com, Gemno.com, Runway.com. 

The data is for non-commercial research purposes only. 
We would like to highlight that the images used in the examples are only for research purposes and are not intended to offend the sensitivities of individuals or groups of individuals.

## Data Organization

The dataset repository includes 14 folders one for each MLLM, T2I/V model or web platform. 

## Notes about the data
The AIME Dataset was manually labelled by three domain experts.
We asked them to evaluate the multimedia content generated by the MLLMs and T2I/V models according to two categories for the binary task, i.e., ethical and unethical content.

The results of the labelling step for the binary tasks have led to the identification of 521 images and 64 videos with unethical content, and 924 images and 46 videos with ethical content. The label columns contain a value of 1 if the content is harmful (unethical), and 0 otherwise (ethical).

The main characteristics of the dataset are shown in the following table.
